## Step 2: "Start coding"

1. Head over to the WPIT repository and copy the HTTPS link of the repository.

2. Create a folder with the name "WPIT" in your machine.

3. Open the command line tool of your choice and head over to the folder we just created.

4. In the folder, run the following command followed by the HTTPS link we copied from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://repository_link
5. Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.

6. Start coding! It's literally that easy!
